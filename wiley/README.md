AbstractClasses 
-----------------------
- This package contains two abstract class implementations
- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated
- It can contain abstract methods or normal methods
- It can only be instantiated by inheriting with a normal class and then defining the methods yourself
- It's good to use when you don't know all the functionality of the class you are making. You can implement the parts you do know, and leave the parts you don't bodiless, ready for those who do know, to fill out the functionality for you in extended classes
